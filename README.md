## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
During this project, I learned how to structure a simple HTML component using semantic tags and apply CSS custom properties for consistent styling. I practiced using Flexbox to center elements both vertically and horizontally, which improved my understanding of layout techniques. Additionally, I reinforced the importance of a mobile-first workflow to ensure the component looks good on all devices.

Hereâ€™s an example of how I used Flexbox to center the QR code:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

I also learned how to optimize images for web and ensure accessibility by providing descriptive alt text.

### Useful resources

 - [box-sizing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing) This article helped me understand how the `box-sizing` property affects element dimensions and layout. I needed to read about it to ensure consistent sizing and spacing for the QR code component, especially when adding padding and borders.
